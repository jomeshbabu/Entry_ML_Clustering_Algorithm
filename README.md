# Entry_ML_Clustering_Algorithm
The Iris dataset is a renowned collection used extensively for testing machine learning algorithms. It consists of 150 samples, each representing one of three species of Iris flowers: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. Each sample is characterized by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all measured in centimeters.

In this study, the dataset was subjected to clustering using two different algorithms: KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering. The KMeans algorithm was able to effectively identify three distinct clusters, aligning closely with the actual species of the flowers. On the other hand, Hierarchical Clustering produced five clusters, which did not correspond as clearly with the true species groupings. Despite this, Hierarchical Clustering may offer deeper insights into sub-clusters within the data, depending on how the distance metrics are configured.

Both algorithms are commonly applied in classification tasks, and while KMeans seems to provide a more accurate grouping in this case, Hierarchical Clustering can reveal additional relationships that might be beneficial for more complex data analysis.
